    "#### This Python script processes panoramic images by dividing them into segments and then splitting each segment into two parts. The script first sets up directories to organize the processed images. Then, it iterates through each panoramic image in a specified folder. For each image, it divides it into four segments, saves each segment as a separate image, and further splits each segment into left and right parts, saving them separately. Finally, it prints a message confirming the completion of the processing for each image. Overall, the script prepares panoramic images for further analysis or manipulation by segmenting them into manageable parts."
